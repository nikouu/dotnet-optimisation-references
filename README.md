# Dotnet Optimization Cheatsheet

Practical neato performance/speed/"hacks" for .NET. Like bypassing safties in your car and ripping out the seats in your car to make it go faster, some of these come with a ‚ö†**RISK**‚ö†. This means you should understand your own scenario and what the relevant risks are. 

So let's just call these *educational*. Each item is fully referenced so you can educate yourself too. Oh and they're more about language features over things like what should be existing good coding practices and architecture.

In respect to taking on something from below:
1. Write unit tests so you have a baseline for your functionality
1. Use something like [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/) to get a before performance baseline
1. Write your change
1. Run tests
1. Benchmark to see if it did improve what you expected

To clarify some key concepts that keep coming back below in as short as possible (as each one can be it's own book):

| Concept     | Synopsis                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance | Speed                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Scalability | Throughput                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Allocations | Boils down to "work the garbage collector need to do". The GC stops our code entirely when cleaning up so if we can relieve pressure. We can also stop inefficient copying of objects around in memory. |

## üü¢ Least Risky 
Nothing too scary here. The documentation should provide you with all the knowledge you need.
